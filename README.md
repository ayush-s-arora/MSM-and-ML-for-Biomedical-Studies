## Multi-Scale Modeling and Machine Learning for Biomedical Studies

This repository contains statistical analysis files for our biomedical machine learning project, A Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Approach to Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Denaturation at Varying Temperature and pH Levels.

- Contributed to research regarding Machine Learning Applications in Biomedical Studies under Prof. Yuefan Deng, Prof. Peng Zhang, and Ziyuan Niu
  - Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's denaturation under various pH and temperature conditions
    - Presented research in an onsite oral presentation at the 2022 MRS Fall Meeting (DS02: Integrating Machine Learning with Simulations for Accelerated Materials Modeling); abstract published at [mrs.org](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2022-mrs-fall-meeting/symposium-sessions/symposium-sessions-detail/2022_mrs_fall_meeting/ds02)
